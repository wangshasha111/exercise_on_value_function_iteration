%% Value function iteration with a Fixed Grid

%% Step 1: Compute the Steady State

% Initially I try to "fsolve" for labor_1 and then solve for the other two
% inputs. Then for robustness I use "fsolve" to work on the system of
% equations of the steady state. Since the results come out significantly
% different, I take the result of the second approach.

% The first approach
% labor_1_SteadyState_function = @(labor_1)labor_1 + 1.14486 * labor_1.^0.67 - 0.9346 * labor_1.^0.165;
% labor_1_y=labor_1_SteadyState_function([0:0.01:6]);
% figure(1);
% plot([0:0.01:6],labor_1_y);
% yline(0); % We can see the nonzero solution lies between 0 and 1, less than 0.5, around 0.3.
% 
% % We could use grid search to find labor_1. But now let's use fsolve.
% opts1 = optimoptions('fsolve','Tolx',1e-6, 'Display','iter');
% labor_1_initial = 0.3; 
% display('Start Solving the Function');
% labor_1_SteadyState = fsolve(@(labor_1) labor_1_SteadyState_function(labor_1), labor_1_initial,opts1);
% display('Solution Obtained.');
% 
% % Print results
% fprintf('The Candidate Solution Is Found to Be: %2.4f \n', labor_1_SteadyState);
% fprintf('The Function Value At this Candidate Solution Is: %2.6f \n', ...
%         labor_1_SteadyState_function(labor_1_SteadyState));
% 
% k_SteadyState = 3.53290 * labor_1_SteadyState;
% labor_2_SteadyState = 1.14486 * labor_1_SteadyState^0.67;
% 
% T = table(k_SteadyState,labor_1_SteadyState,labor_2_SteadyState)

% The second approach: Use fsolve to solve the system of equations
    
input_ss_initial=[0.9,0.2,0.5];
opts1 = optimoptions('fsolve','Tolx',1e-6, 'Display','iter');

display('Start Solving the Function');
SS = fsolve(@(input_ss) steadyStateFunction(input_ss,bbeta,ddelta,aalphaK,aalphaL,mmu_1,mmu_2), input_ss_initial,opts1);
display('Solution Obtained.');
kSteadyState = SS(1);
labor_1_SteadyState = SS(2);
labor_2_SteadyState = SS(3);
fprintf('The Candidate Solution Is Found to Be: %2.4f \n', SS);
fprintf('The Function Value At this Candidate Solution Is: %2.6f \n', ...
        steadyStateFunction(SS,bbeta,ddelta,aalphaK,aalphaL,mmu_1,mmu_2));

consumption_1_SteadyState = consumptionFunction1(1,kSteadyState,kSteadyState,labor_1_SteadyState,aalphaK,aalphaL,ddelta);
consumption_2_SteadyState = consumptionFunction2(1,labor_2_SteadyState);
utilitySteadyState = utilityFunction(consumption_1_SteadyState,consumption_2_SteadyState,labor_1_SteadyState,labor_2_SteadyState,mmu_1,mmu_2);

T = table(kSteadyState,labor_1_SteadyState,labor_2_SteadyState,consumption_1_SteadyState,consumption_2_SteadyState)

%% Step 2: set up k grid around the steady state
kSpread = 0.3;
kMax = kSteadyState * (1 + kSpread);
kMin = kSteadyState * (1 - kSpread);
Nk = 250;
vGrid_k = linspace(kMin,kMax,Nk)';
inputs.vGrid_k = vGrid_k;

%% Step 3. Pre-Iteration: Set labor to steady state

% Iterate on the Value function implied by the Social Planner¡¯s Problem using linear interpolation
% until the change in the sup norm between to iterations is less than 1e-6.
% Compute the Policy function.
% Describe the responses of the economy to a technology shock.

% We can see from the question that once given a1,a2,k,and chosen k',
% labor_1, labor_2 are both chosen by optimization, and consumption_1,
% consumption_2 are both chosen immediately.

% So we need to write a function laborFunction.m from a1,a2,k,k' to labor_1,labor_2
% And we need to write consumption functions consumptionFunction1.m,
% consumptionFunction2.m

% consumptionFunction1 = @(a_1,k,kPrime,labor_1,aalphaK,aalphaL,ddelta)a_1 * k^aalphaK * labor_1^aalphaL + (1-ddelta) * k - kPrime;
% consumptionFunction2 = @(a_2,labor_2)a_2 * labor_2;
